This project is designed to convert [Silvrback](https://silvrback.com) XML exports to individual Markdown files compatible with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Add Your `blog.xml` to the same directoy as the project (not solution).
3. Run the project

## Expected Output

a folder called `_posts` should appear with all your posts.

## Tweaks

There is a `template.md` file that allows you to change the Jekyll destination format to what you need.
